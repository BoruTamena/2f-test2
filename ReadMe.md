# Go Programming Challenges

This repository contains solutions to three programming challenges using Go. Each challenge focuses on different aspects of Go concurrency, data structures, and channel usage.

## Challenge 1: Concurrent Integer Increment

**Problem:**
Write a program that starts two goroutines that both increment an integer every second. Use a channel to signal the main routine when the integer has reached a certain value.

**Solution:**
See the provided Go program in the file `incrementer.go`. This program demonstrates the use of goroutines and channels to achieve concurrent integer incrementation.

## Challenge 2: Generic Stack Implementation

**Problem:**
Implement a generic stack with the following methods: Push, Pop, Empty. Ensure that the function works with slices of integers, floats, or strings.

**Solution:**
Refer to the Go implementation in the file `generic_stack.go`. This solution showcases the creation of a generic stack that can handle various data types using interfaces.

## Challenge 3: Messaging System Simulation

**Problem:**
Write a Go program that simulates a messaging system using channels. Implement functionality for sending messages from one goroutine to another through channels, ensuring that the main function waits for both goroutines to finish execution before exiting.

**Solution:**
Check out the provided Go program in `messaging.go`. This program illustrates the use of channels to facilitate communication between goroutines in a simple messaging system. The main function ensures proper synchronization by waiting for the completion of both goroutines.

Feel free to explore the source code for each challenge and adapt them to your specific needs or learnings. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or contribute to the repository.
